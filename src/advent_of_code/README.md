# Breakdown of Files

Here is a breakdown of the various files in this directory. Files with names of the form `dayNN.clj` represent the code actually used to solve the problems (with some tweaking done using a static analysis plug-in for Leinengen). Files with `bis` in the name are modified/tuned versions of the given original day.

The numbers in parentheses in the descriptions of the files represent the rank I had for when my solutions were submitted and accepted.

## day01.clj

Day 1 (117847/112793, approx. 15 min).

Didn't start this one until about 5:30PM on Dec 1st. Good time overall, but high rank-numbers because of this.

## day02.clj

Day 2 (11129/11550, 44 min).

This took much longer than it should have because I did it brute-force instead of thinking it out...

## day03.clj

Day 3 (7751/5831, 27 min).

This one was fun, and Clojure's native support for sets and set operations made it even easier.

## day04.clj

Day 4 (71071/68913, about 30 min).

Another sets-based problem!

## day05.clj

Day 5 (82318/79988, unknown).

Borrowed the parsing code and some other bits.

## day06.clj

Day 6 (18189/17565).

Weak. Brute forced it.

## day07.clj

Day 7 (54835/52953).

Strong. File-system parsing and depth-first searching. A typo caused me to get part 1 wrong on the first try. Ugh.

## day08.clj

Day 8 (15093/13986).

More ugh.

## day09.clj

Day 9 (49106/39353).

I had an advantage from doing it so late, that I knew what the second half was. I wrote the first half with enough engineering to handle the second as well.

## day10.clj

Day 10 (12580/11514).

Part 1 was a breeze, part 2 was another "read the letters this ASCII stream forms" kind of puzzles, which don't do much for me. But part 2 worked right the first time, no debugging except for getting the screen output readable.

## day11.clj

Day 11 (--/--).

Day 12 (--/--).
